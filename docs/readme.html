	<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
	<p>break_detector is a simple command-line Python model of the life and death 
	of a part undergoing Accelerated Life Testing (ALT) and an idea I had a while 
	back on an easy way to detect failures.</p>
	<p>Suppose you have a new part and you want to get an idea for how long it can 
	stay in use before it's likely to wear out: it's mean time to failure (MTTF). 
	One way to do this is to subject the part to ALT: put it in a chamber and apply 
	heightened levels of moisture, corrosive agents, heat, cold, etc. to make it 
	age more quickly than in a normal environment. Since each part won't necessarily 
	fail at the same time, you need to subject more than one part to ALT to figure 
	out the part's average lifetime.</p>
	<p>The problem is that you need to test a lot of parts to ALT, and you need 
	to know when they fail. That means either having a data acquisition system that 
	can take dozens or even hundreds of inputs simultaneously, or hiring somebody 
	to watch the ALT chambers 24/7 to record when each part fails. Either option 
	is expensive.</p>
	<p>I had an idea about how you could run several parts on a single data acquisition 
	input, but I needed a way to see if it might work in real life. So I put together 
	this program to simulate a part that fails and the idea I had to detect the 
	failure; run it a few thousand times and you have a Monte Carlo simulation of 
	the system and a better idea if it would be feasible.</p>
	<p>Skip to <a href="#Basic_Usage">Basic Usage</a> if you just want to run break_detector; 
	read on if you want to know about the instrumentation.</p>
	<h2>Instrumentation</h2>
	<p>Imagine your part is clamped on one end and a heavy weight is attached to 
	the other end:</p>
	<img alt="Diagram of part in ALT" class="center" height="640" src="img/alt_part_s.png" width="384" />
	<p>You might do something similar if you were testing a piece of fabric, Kevlar 
	strand, or something similar in ALT: the weight keeps the tension in the part, 
	and at some point the part fails by breaking. Now imagine that you attach a 
	resistor to the part, and that resistor's wire leads are fine copper wires (like 
	magnet wire):</p>
	<img alt="Diagram of part in ALT with resistor failure sensor" class="center" height="517" src="img/alt_instrumented_part_s.png" width="480" />
	<p>Now when the part breaks, the magnet wires will break as well. Whatever electrical 
	resistance you were reading across the resistor now goes up to "infinity" (not 
	really) as there is no complete electrical circuit anymore.</p>
	<p>If you take several of these instrumented parts and put known resistors of 
	different values across them, you can wire up their respective resistors in 
	parallel:</p>
	<img alt="Diagram of networked instrumented parts" class="center" height="214" src="img/resistor_network.png" width="640" />
	<p>Now when you take an electrical resistance reading, it's the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thévenin's_theorem">Thévenin equivalent</a> 
	of the network of resistors. If you choose your initial resistors wisely, then 
	you should be able to measure this Thévenin resistance and know which parts 
	have failed and which are still intact. That means that instead of using one 
	input for each part, you can wire up several parts to each input on your data 
	acquisition system and save a lot of money in the process.</p>
	<p>What the break_detector program does is simulate both the random failure 
	of a part and the measured resistance readings. You configure break_detector 
	with an initial pick of resistors; after running through a few thousand simulations 
	you can find out if the expected resistance readings are sufficiently different 
	that you will be able to back out which parts failed and when based on only 
	a measured resistance.</p>
	<h1><a name="System Requirements">System Requirements</a></h1>
	<p>break_detector is written in pure <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> 
	and has been tested under OS X Lion and Windows 7, and should work on any platform 
	with Python 2.7 (no extra libraries required). It also works under
	<a href="http://pypy.org/download.html">PyPy 1.5</a> or higher.</p>
	<h1><a name="Basic_Usage">Basic Usage</a></h1>
	<p><tt>python break_detector.py [-nNumSims] [-m] [-oOutputDestination] [-c] 
	[-tCollisionTolerance]</tt></p>
	<p>To specify a specific number of simulations to run, use <tt>-nNumSims</tt>, 
	e.g. <tt>-n1000</tt> to run 1,000 simulations.</p>
	<p>By default break_detector uses a single process to run the simulations, but 
	if you'd like to use multiple processes use the <tt>-m</tt> switch. This will 
	instruct break_detector to use as many processes as your computer has CPUs; 
	you likely won't notice any increase in performance (time to finish the simulations) 
	but it will consume less of each CPU's power.</p>
	<p>To specify an output destination for the simulation results, use <tt>-oOutputDestination</tt>, 
	e.g. <tt>-oresults.csv</tt> to save the results to the file results.csv. Results 
	are stored as ASCII-delimited text files.</p>
	<p>To quickly get a good/no-good analysis of your results, use the <tt>-c</tt> 
	argument to have break_detector run the analysis for you automatically. As of 
	right now it looks for "obvious" resistance reading collisions: if a single 
	electrical resistance reading is found in the results and was produced by more 
	than one combination of failed sensors, this resistor network wouldn't be able 
	to differentiate between the failure states in a real ALT test. Future updates 
	to the analysis will run an additional analysis check to make sure that individual 
	resistance readings are sufficiently far apart (as will be specified by the
	<tt>-tCollisionTolerance</tt> flag, defaults to 0.1).</p>
	<p>By default break_detector simulates a four-sensor network of 2 M&Omega;, 3 M&Omega;, 
	4 M&Omega;, and 5 M&Omega; resistors. If you'd like to try other network configurations, 
	edit the <tt>break_detector.py</tt> file and edit the <tt>build_part_configs</tt> 
	function's <tt>resistances = [...]</tt> statement to as many or as few nominal 
	resistances as you'd like.</p>
	<p>To determine if your configuration would work in real life or not, examine 
	the output of the simulation runs. Ideally you should see a fairly large difference 
	between the resistance readings; more than about ten percent or so to be conservative. 
	If this is the case, this means that for any given resistance reading you would 
	take in a real life ALT setup you'd be able to back out which parts had failed 
	and which were still intact.</p>
